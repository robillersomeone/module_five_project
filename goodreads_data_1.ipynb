In book 1 of this series, the dwarf-human nation of Ormdel, and the nations of Byrum, Oldon, and Kelorman all join forces in a war against the invasive Barbarians intent on destroying the villages and kingdoms in their path. The hero is a young man named Jonathan who is ripped from a normal peasant life and taken under the care of his mentor, Sir Richard, who transforms him into a valiant warrior.I’m not a reader of Fantasy, but I found this story to be an exception. The characters are so realistic; and the fight scenes are vivid and well described as they try to end the evil that threatens life as they know it. I find Enden to be a well-written book created by a very talented author. I highly recommend this book as well as all of his books.\\n...more',\n",

After reading this book, I've come to two conclusions--I'm not into cozy mysteries. So, why did I give it a three-star instead of two or one? Because even though I might not have been able to get into it, I know other readers who like this genre will. First let me say, the writing is unique and superb. The way this author describes sounds and the atmosphere around you is unique in his own way, and that makes the story so vivid and alive. I really liked that part. His characters are so realistic; and it's a clean novel. If this author wrote suspense, I would definitely buy more of his books. But the story just didn't hold my attention. And the second conclusion is, I don't like stories told in first person; even though he kept the point-of-view to one character and not every one in the book, is a plus.If you like cozy mysteries, you'll like this book.\\n...more\",\n",

The Agatha Christie series on PBS are my favorite to watch, so I thought it would make an even better read because they always say, the books are much better—not always. Although it is not her fault, the formatting of this book is terrible. One moment you think different characters are speaking, when in actuality, it’s only one. That can be so confusing! This is a cozy mystery which tends to go on and on with a lot of dialogue. And that’s what this storyline consists mostly of, lots and lots of conversation; very little action and description of settings and scenes; and you're constantly whiplashed from one place to the next. Instead of one or two point of views, you get the point of view of every character in this book, and they all are thinking the same thing. So besides point-of-view overkill, it gets rather repetitive and boring. And the characters read like lifeless cardboards. I felt nothing for any of them. I didn’t care who did it, or if they lived or died, or went off to a happy-ever-after.I was really disappointed given the status of Miss Christie. So I’ll just stick to her television series which are way better than the books.\\n...more\",\n",

This is hers: “A codependent person is one who has let another person’s behavior affect him or her, and who is obsessed with controlling that person’s behavior. She offers a very extensive, detailed and very practical list of codependent characteristics such as: caretaking – low self-worth – repression – obsessions – controlling behavior – denial – dependency – poor communication – weak boundaries – luck of trust – anger – sex problems etc. Dependency may be manifested in various ways, for example: codependents don’t feel happy, content, or peaceful with themselves. I can certainly have identified with most of the characteristic for a very long time, especially with: weak boundaries. I have benefitted greatly from this book: very effective and very practical.I am happy to report that, for the past several years, I have been able to avoid being trapped by codependent relationships.

Movies are an absolutely wonderful way not only to entertain ourselves but also to receive a huge amount of inspiration. Good movies can actually raise our spirits and heal us in many ways: sometimes consciously sometimes sub-consciously. This is what I wrote about in Missing Links, pages 268 and 269: Benefitting from inspiring moviesEntertaining and inspiring movies are the result of a collective process of creativity which may involve some of the most talented and creative people on our planet. As I have already shared in Chapter 12, I tend to agree completely with Shakespeare when he writes in As You Like It, ( II, 7):“All the world’s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.”Quite often I don’t know where life ends and theatre begins and vice versa, and ... quite frankly, I no longer care. A wonderful example of this can be found in Robert Altman’s film Cookie’s Fortune, starring Glenn Close, Julianne More & Co. I find that life is a never-ending adventure and thatgood movies are a wonderful extension of our lives. Movies and theatre are a wonderful way to learn more about ourselves, about others and about the world in which we live. At the same time we are also being entertained. I often refer to movies because they are easily accessible to most of us. They can be viewed in our homes, and we can enjoy them even when we are tired. When I buy movies I try to buy only those movies that inspire me, that educate me and that I find entertaining. The movies I watch over and over, are the movies that are the most entertaining and the most inspiring. I find that movies are one of the most readily available and one of most effective sources of information, entertainment and inspiration. For more on this I refer you to the book The Motion Picture Prescription, by Gary Solomon.\\n...more',\n",
